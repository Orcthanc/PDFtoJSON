# DnDPDFtoJSON

This project aims to convert DnD 5e char-sheets from pdf to JSON.
It will probably have hardcoded values for the awesome "Inky 5eRV" charsheets found at http://www.enworld.org/forum/rpgdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=1390

It also depends on the Apache licensed project PDF-Writer and all it's dependencies, the license can be found under external/PDF-Writer/LICENSE. The source can be found at https://github.com/galkahana/PDF-Writer
